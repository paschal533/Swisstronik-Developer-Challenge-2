 # Swisstronik Developer Challenge 2

Create a smart contract with a single private state variable (string or uint) and develop functions to modify and retrieve this value. Deploy the contract to the Mumbai testnet and Swisstronik testnet, and write a script to access this variable using the RPC method eth_getStorageAt() on both networks. 

# ðŸ›  test the smart-contract:

```
npm install

npx hardhat test
```

# ðŸŽ¡ Access the variable using the RPC method eth_getStorageAt() on both networks

```
npx hardhat run scripts/accessStorage.js
```
